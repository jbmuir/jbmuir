I'm a 5◊sup{th} year graduate student in geophysics at the California Institute of Technology Seismological Laboratory (e.g. Caltech Seismolab). I'm passionate about inverse problems --- some of the projects I'm working on now are: imaging the Earth from near surface to the core; improving data captured at seismic arrays; and answering difficult questions about historical data sets.
